"""End-to-end pipeline integration test — real graph, real LLM, all 5 stages.

This is the only test that exercises the full multi-agent pipeline as a single
run: preprocess -> analysis -> reasoning -> strategy -> report, driven through
the real LangGraph graph (``app.core.graph.build_graph``) with the real agent
implementations and live LLM calls.

Unlike ``test_graph.py`` (full graph, mocked agents) and ``test_integration.py``
(real LLM, but only analysis -> reasoning), this joins both halves: the actual
graph wiring AND real model output across every stage.

Design notes:
- Uses a small fixed in-memory sample instead of scanning the 5.3 GB Yelp review
  file, so the test is deterministic and does not depend on the dataset files.
- The sample is crafted with a shared wait-time / service complaint so the
  reasoning stage has a genuine recurring pattern to detect.

Run with:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/test_e2e_pipeline.py -v -m integration

Skips automatically when OPENAI_API_KEY is not set.
